## Changed

### Release Pipeline Refactoring

The monolithic release workflow has been restructured into a **4-stage pipeline**:

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  Pre-check  │ → │   Prepare   │ → │    Build     │ → │  Distribute │ → Publish
│             │    │             │    │              │    │             │
│ Skip check  │    │ Version     │    │ Bump version │    │ Drive upload│
│ Label check │    │ type detect │    │ Changelog    │    │ Redmine news│
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    │ Build ZIP    │    └─────────────┘
                                      └──────────────┘
```
